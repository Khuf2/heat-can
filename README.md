# Introduction to Python Programming Summer Course
## Modules and one-on-one instruction for an efficient, Socratic introduction to programming foundations in Python. I will go over:
#### - Object-oriented programming
#### - Functions
#### - Factoring (the division of a program into subfunctions) 
#### - Python essentials and syntax
At UCSC, our professors urge us to understand how to create most of the pre-existing functions that we use in our assignments. Similarly, many of the homework or classwork assignments I give to your student will teach them to manually code built-in Python functions that already exist in the language, allowing them to better understand what is going on “underneath the hood,” while also teaching them to program in Python and advancing their problem-solving abilities.
# Course Schedule:
#### Week 1: Primitive types, lists/arrays, list/strings methods, conditionals, loops
#### Week 2: Nested loops, string building, string manipulation, array slicing
#### Week 3: Dictionaries, tuples, objects
#### Week 4: Project (Dungeon Crawl, or other) development


After the first four weeks, we can tailor the program to your student's interests, and target areas to fully develop their final project. If they aren’t interested in furthering their project, we can round out the end of the course by introducing the topics of classes and constructors, possibly even inheritance if we move quickly through the modules.
