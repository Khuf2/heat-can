# I will show you how to use VScode and terminal.

# Testing:
# You can test functions by tinkering with the values below in the test call zone. Then simply type:
# python hw1_submission.py

# Final Scoring:
# When you finish, navigate to your code directory in Terminal and run with python hw1_tests.py
# This uses your code in this file and prints test results.

# The list you will use for your testing is this one here:
list = [10, 30, 40, 35, 65, 25, 40, 85, 105, 55, 55]


# (Easy) Write the code for two functions, removeAll() and smartAdd().

# removeAll()
# Removes all instances of an element from a list, or 
# does nothing if the element isn't there.
def removeAll(e):
    # Your code starts here. e is like x from lesson, the element you are removing.
    print (None)

# Test call to the function.
removeAll(40)



# smartAdd() will add a new element to the back of a list, but 
# will do nothing if the  element already exists in the list. (i.e. no duplicates)
def smartAdd(e):
    # Your code starts here
    print (None)

# Test call to the function.
smartAdd(85)





# (Medium) Write the code for the function, getMin().

# getMin()
# Finds and returns the lowest numerical value in the list.
def getMin():
    # Your code starts here 
    return (None)

print (getMin())
