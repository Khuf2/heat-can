'''
# blitz(): basic string-building from a list
Given a list of names, return a greeting message to each name in the form of a string.
If addressing more than one person, add an and to your final welcome, and adjust capitalization accordingly.
It should look like this:
# blitz(["Aldo", "Beto", "Carlo"]) = "Welcome, Aldo. Welcome, Beto. And welcome, Carlo."
# blitz(["Arty"]) = "Welcome, Arty."
'''
def blitz(names):
    # Your code starts here.
    return "String"
        

print ( blitz(["Aldo", "Beto", "Carlo"]) )


'''
# manualCount()
Given a string (text), a target string (word), return an int 
that equals how many times (word) appears in (text).

'''
def manualCount(text, word):
    # Your code starts here.
    return 0


# Test call = 2
print ( manualCount("Hoot Hoot Smoot Loot I Shoot Big Frisbees (1825) ##$ - Syrup", "Hoot") )


'''
# replace()
Given a string (text), a target string (word), and a replacement string (rep), 
return a new string with all instances of (word) replaced with (rep).
Hint: This is very similar to the last problem
'''
def replace(text, word, rep):
    # Your code starts here.
    return "String"
    
# test call = "No No No No Smoot Loot I Shoot Big Frisbees (1825) ##$ - Syrup"
print ( replace("Hoot Hoot Smoot Loot I Shoot Big Frisbees (1825) ##$ - Syrup", "Hoot", "No No") )
